## COMPUTER ORGANIZATION AND SOFTWARE SYSTEMS

# DAY 1

	Initially Computers were used for Data Processing.



	Telemetry - Measurement from a Distance
	
	DataBase
		RDBMS
	
	Data Mining
	
	Data analysis

	AI & ML
	



	Assessment Pattern:
	
		Quizzes - 5%  (Duration 30 mins)
		
		Assignment - 25% (2 Assignments)
			
			Lab Assignments:
				Platifi
		
		MID Sem and Comprehensive Exam - Open Book
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Describe Computer?
	
	Hardware Organisation of Computer:
	
		Bus 
			Holds 	-Address Bus
					-Data Bus
					-Control Bus
		
		
		System Bus 
		IO Bus (USB, Graphics Adapter)
		Memory Bus (Main Memory)
	
	
	von neumann's Architecture:
		
		Single path between CPU and main memory is called von neumann's Bottleneck.
	
	
	Harvard's Architecture:
	
	
	
	Instruction Cycle Diagram:
	
		Instruction execution:
			-Fetch
			-Execute
	
	
	Fetch Cycle
	
	Execute Cycle
	
		Processor -> Memory
		Processor -> I/O
		Data Processing
		Control
		Combination of above
		
	Interrupt Cycle
	
	
	Program Flow Control
	
	
	Type of Interrupts:
	
		Program
		Timer
		I/O
		Hardware failure
		
		
	Memory Hierarchy:
		Register
		Cache (L1 (nearer to CPU), L2, L3)
		Main Memory (DRAM)
		Local Storage
		Remote Storage
		
	
	Operating System:
	
		- intermediary between users of a computer and the computer hardware.
		
		3 main functions:
			Resource Management
			Establish an User Interface
			Execute and provide services for application software.
			
		OS Operations:
		
		
		Running a Hello.c program:
		
			Preprocessor -> Compiler -> Assembler -> Linker
			

	KERNEL:
				
		One program that is running in computer all time is KERNEL.
		
	Bootstrap program is loaded at POWER-UP or REBOOT.
	
	Firmware - typically stored in ROM or EPROM.
