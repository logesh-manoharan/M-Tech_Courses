## Introduction to Data Science

# DAY - 2

Challenges in Data Science:
	
	
	

Roles in Data Science:
	- Chief Data
	- Data Analyst - analysing the data using some programming      languages R, Python etc.,
	- Business Analyst - help the Data analyst
	- Data Scientist - Data mining, ML
		. Machine Learning Engineer
		. Data Journalist - Skills: SQL, Python, R, Scala, Tableau etc.,
	- Data Architect - ensures Integrity
	- Data Engineer - Hardware parts(Storage Capacity)
	- Application / Data Visualization engineer
	
	
	
	Does my organisation has all this roles?
			Depends on the volume of the work.
			
			Totally dependent on Data Analytics all these roles will be present.
			

Data Scientist:

	Classified based on Purpose:
		- For Analysis
		- For Building   
			
	
	Skills required for Data Scientist:
	
		Communicative
		Qualitative
		Technical
		Skeptical
		Creative - Telling story
		Curious
		....
		
		
	Tools available for Data Scientist:
	
	
	
	Algorithms for a Data Scientist:
	
		K-Means Clustering - IDS
		Logistic Regression
		Linear Regression - ML
		Apriori - DS
		Decision tree
		ANN - DL
		SVM - ML
		PCA - MFDS(Mass Flow Detection System)
	

		!!Depending on the Problems Data Scientist should choose the appropriate TOOLS and ALGORITHMS
		
		
	Organisation of DS Team:
		- Centralised
		- Decentralised
		- Consulting
		- Center of Excellence
		
	Software Engineering Techniques:
		- WaterFall Modal -> Sequential
		- Iterative Modal -> Iterative
		- Agile Method
			. CI / CD (Continuous Integration and COntinuous Development)
			. Getting continuos feedback from the End User/ Customer / Client
			. Client no need to wait for entire implementation.
			. Entire product will be much better. Since, client is interacting more.
			. Safe
			
	
	Data Science Life Cycle:
	
	
	
	Data Science vs Software Engineering:
	
		- In Data Science, We are dealing Data against the Software.
		- Process oriented life cycle
		
	
	
	DataOPS - for Data Management
	
		Includes,
			DevOPS
			Agile
			Lean Manufaturing (reducing wastes)
	
		Data Analytics Pipeline: 
			Data Ingestion -> Data Transformation -> Analysis -> Visualization

		Data Ingestion: collect, clean(prepare), store
			
		Tasks:
			Preparation
			Feature Engg
			Modeling
			Evaluation
			
		Managers of Data - Data engineer, ,Architect etc.,
		
		Customers/ Consumers of Data - Data Analyzt, BI Team
		
		
	DataOPS Examples:
	
		Movie release on Every Friday.
			- Did anyone attaching the Movie details to the Specific Actor or Dirators Movie list ?
		Dashboards of COVID news gets changes in every Hour. 
			- Did every anyone is updating the data ?
		
		
		Automation is needed there. (Data Analytics Pipeline)
		
		How much of Data Automations needed was decided by DataOPS Engineer.
		
		
	Teams involved in DataOPS:
		Data Manager
		Data Consumers
		DevOPS (Deployments)
		
		


	MLOps:  (Totally different from DataOPS)
		
		Training  -> MODEL  -> Predictions
		
		
	
		DataOPS -> MLOps
		
		



	Data Analytics:
		
		- To predict something - predicting the RAIN FALL
		- To find patterns in the data - top 10 songs, movies, most searched news. 
		- To find the relationships in the Data - finding similar things(images, news articles)
		
	
	Analytics Tasks:
	
		- Descriptive -> how much did it rain yesterday or one week back ?
			Techniques:
				Visualization - Histogram
			
		- Predictive  -> What will be rainfall next 5 days?
			
			- Looking into the Future
			
			Techniques:
				Regression
				Classification
				Deep Learning Techiniques
		
		- Diagnostic  -> Figuring out what happended ?
			Why did the FLOOD happended ?
			
			Asking WHY WHY WHY by looking into the PAST....?
			
			Identifying the relationship.
			
			Techniques/ Tools:
				. Pattern Recognition
				. Linear / Logistic Regression
				. Neural Network
				. Deep learning techniques
				
		- Prescriptive ->

			What might happen if i do these things ?
			
			Take these decisions then it will happen for you. Like, Prescriptions while consulting the Doctor.
			
			
			Use AI to improve Decision making
			
			eg: If it rains for 5 days in specific area, FLOOD may happen at that place. Please, take correct actions to prevent Flood and save peoples.
