# DAY - 3

Data:
	- collection of objects and their attributes

	Observations - Attributes or Features or Variables or Fields or Characteristics- Medical Observations -> by using some attibutes we can decide the Person is having Diabetes or not. 
	
		Relevant or Irrelevant features: (which Attribute is important)
			
			
	
	Facts
	
	Figures
	
	
	
	Properties of Attributes:
		- Distinctiveness =, !=
		- Order <, >, <=, >=
		- Addition +, -
		- Multiplication *, /
	
	
	Types of Attributes:
	
		Numerical - ratio, interval (+, -)
			- Ratio (*, /)
				- Absolute ZERO(0) - absence of Property - some impossible values eg: 0 Kelvin is not possible at any place so it ABSOLUTE 0 but, [0 degree Celcius or FarenHeat, 0 gram weight, 0 Length] is not an Absolute ZERO.
				
			- Interval (+, -)
				
		Categorical 
			- ordinal (grades, shirt size)[we will maintain ORDER] (>,<), eg: OrderBy GRADE 
			- Nominal (eye colors) (=, !=)
		
		
	Attributes by the Number of Values:
		Discrete - Binaries
		Continuous - Real Numbers (includes Floating Point Values too)
		Asymmetric - mark the Presence with some value
		
		
	How can we find the types of Data ?
		By following 'what are all the operations we can do?'
		
		If we made any transformation, it should be valid.
		
	Based on the Operation:
		Can I do Multiplication or Addition or Comparison ?
		
		
	Exercise:
		ID, Age, Gender, Course ID, CGPA, Grade
		
	
	Sol:
		ID - Nominal
		Age - Ratio
		Gender - Nominal
		Course ID - Nominal
		CGPA - Ratio
		Grade - Ordinal
	
	
		Discrete or Continuous ?
			Discrete   - All the Categorical Data are DISCRETE - ID, Gender, CourseID, Grade
			Continuous - Age, CGPA
			
	
	Questions at last:
		Can you please share some exercises to findout the type of Attributes ?
		
		
	
	DATA-SETS:
			Types of DataSets:
				Structured
					Data type, Format, Structure
					
					it can be NULL
					
					eg: CSV, Spreadseets, RDBMS, 
				Semi-Structured
					eg: XML, HTML, JSON
				Quasi-Structured
				Unstructured
