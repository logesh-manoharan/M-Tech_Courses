### IDS - DAY - 4



Data Quality Index


	Data Quality Isssues:
	
		Noise and outline - Random error(includes Typing Error) eg: Date value is having only Day and Month
		
		Inaccurate data - human or machine error. Error in Data transmission
		
		Inconsistent data - logical mistakes
		
		Missing data
		
		Duplicate data
		
		Orphaned data
		
		Text encoding errors
		
		Data that is biased
		
		
			Find out the quality issues?
			
			
	Data Model: (used to resolve the issues of Data QUality eg: using some binomial expression we can fillout the Missing Data)
	
		we will construct to understand the real world.
		
		
		1 - Start with Expectation
		2 - Compare the expectation with reality 
		3 - Refining expectations
			- Get different model or Data [ is selected model is having some mistakeso r wrong ]

	
	Skew Data - model should fit into the Skew Data. [tends towards particular set of values]
	
	
	
	
	Class or Concept Description:
		derived using,
			- data characterization
			- data discrimination
			- both data characterization and discrimination
			
	Association Analyses:
		
	Prediction Analysis:
	
	Clustering: (grouping according to the characteristcis/behaviour - eg: group products)
		 - grouping objects together
		 
		 
	Data Pipeline	
	
		Why we build Data Pipeline?
			we need to automate whenever we get the data with minimal human intervention
			
		Data Ingestion:
			exctracting the data and loading it into the another source.

				
			ELT Pipeline - Extract -> Load -> Transform
				Data Engineer -Extraction and Loading
				Data Analyzt - Transform
				
			ETL - Extract -> Transform -> Load
			
		Orchestrating the Pipeline:
			Many tools are there.
			Sequencing the tasks.

			Symmetric data and Skewed Data
			
			Mean - Mode = 3(Mean - Median)
			
			For Unimodel data:
			
				Skewed Data
					- Positive (mode < median)
					- Negative (mode > median)
					
					
			
			Data Dispersion Measures:
				Ranges
				Quantiles
				Quartiles or Percentiles
				Interquartile Range(IQR) - (Q3[3rd Quartile] - Q1[1st Quartile])
				Five Number/ Five Point Summary [Minimum, Q1, Median, Q3, Maximum] - Box Plot Model
				Variance
				Standard Deviation
				
			How to calculate values for Quartile:
			
				eg: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12]
				
					Arrange the SET in ASCENDING Order first.
					
					N / 4 = 12 / 4 = 3  [take every 3rd element]
					
					Q1(3rd value) - 3, Q2(6th value) - 6, Q3() - 9, Q4 - 12
					
					IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 9 - 3 = 6
				
				
		Data Preparation:
		
			Data Cleansing
			
			Data Transformation
			
			Combining data
