	Why do I need Data Science in my domain Telecom?
		
		To solve certain Business Requirements - eg: attaining More PROFIT
		
		Customer Satisfaction.
		
		What our Business should to next.
		
		Strategies for Selling the products.
		
	
	Algorithm: Steps of instruction to solve the problem. It can be PSEUDO CODE / Simple Steps in English.
	
	Eg: Processing the Queue in Movie Theatres.
	
	
	
	DS - AI - ML
	
		DS - it uses some of the algorithms from ML.
		
		
		ML - Is part of Artificial Intelligence.
			- SVM
			- kNN
			- Deep Learning
			
			eg: Product Recommendation in Amazon
		
		
		AI - to make the machine to think like a Human.
		
			eg: Facial Recognition, Automatic Driving Car, Chat Bot
